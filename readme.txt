The PhoneBook Bot project is a command-line-based Java application designed to offer a user-friendly and interactive platform for managing contacts. With a comprehensive set of features, users can perform essential phonebook operations, including adding new contacts, searching for existing entries, modifying contact details, and deleting entries.

The application employs ANSI escape codes to enhance the console interface, providing colorful and formatted output. Users are guided through various commands, such as "/write" for adding new contacts and "/find" for searching existing ones. Additionally, the bot supports data persistence by allowing users to write contact information to a CSV file using the "/writeToFile" command.

To cater to developer needs, the application incorporates a set of developer commands for debugging and administrative tasks. Security measures, such as a developer login with a password, enhance the application's overall robustness.

While the project showcases a variety of functionalities, including thread delays for a smoother user experience, there is room for improvement in terms of code structure and error handling. The PhoneBook Bot project is a practical demonstration of a Java-based phonebook application, offering a blend of functionality and user interaction in a console environment.
